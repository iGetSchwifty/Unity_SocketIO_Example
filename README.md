# Unity SocketIO Example

This repo contains two files that demonstrate how to use SocketIO with Unity in order to make a cross platform multiplayer game. 

## Installation

Use the repo [SocketIO](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/socket.io-unity) to install SocketIo for Unity.


Note this is a pretty dirty server implementation written a couple years ago. It should be used as a base to get you started with understanding Unity and SocketIO. Please try to write code that is testable!
